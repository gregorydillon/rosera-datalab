# Offline Datalab

## Introduction
An extension to the medium post by Lak Lakshmanan. 

The basic premise is to allow Datalab to run locally, so no network connection is required. This repository enables Crostini enabled Chromebooks to get in on the fun. 
## Pixelbook installation
By default on a linux enabled Pixelbook, there should already a virtual machine created. To access the virtual machine instance, press CTRL-ALT-T on the keyboard to open a CROSH browser tab. 

Personally when I am experimenting with new configurations, I like to  do this in a separate VM. If you would rather create this in the default VM, please ignore this step and start the default VM as usual.

'''vmc start sandbox



## Issues
Please feel free to fork the code, if you find it helpful.
